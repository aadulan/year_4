### Teaching mathematics in secondary schools : a reader

#### Being mathematically educated in the twenty-first century: what should it mean?

##### Introduction

- Mathematics was a subject studied by the elite few
- Nineteenth century (grammar and public schools) only had a small number of children 
  - Maths taught in the class was pure (geometry) | topics that would be useful to a nation of inventors
  - anything above basic education was a waste of resources
- ***Education Act 1870*** - introduced compulsory education until 1988 where a **National Curriculum** was introduced
- 1960s & 1970s -> UK economic interests to have an educated, skilled workforce. Too many people were leaving school both earlier and less well-qualified that contential counterparts. Emerging economies started booming

##### Mathematics in the twentieth century 

- 1900 David Hilbert gave a talk to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris 
  - He discussed 23 unsolved problems he forecast would take attention of mathematicans.
- New topics sprung up in the last century; mathematical statistics, discrete maths and applications, quantum mechanics, chaos and game theory
  - Geometry & analysis have advanced 

##### Some aspects of Mathematics in schools 

Standards of instruction to allow a school to be certified as efficient (1876):

- 50% of people above 7 years old will be tested(in reading, writing & arthmetic)
  - 50% should pass in 2 subjects. 50% should pass in arthemtic 
- 7 - 8 years: form figures up to 20, name at sight figures up to 20, add& subtract figures up to 10, orally and from board
- 8 - 10 years: Simple addition & subtraction of numbers <= figures. Mutliplications tables to 6 
- 10 years +: Short division 
- Looking at how maths was tested at schools from 1933 contained 10 questions. 
  - 3 questions on 'pure' geometry 
  - 2 on pratical arthmetic
  - 1 on scale drawing. graphs, trigonometry, algebraic manipulation, number and proof
- With algbraic manipulation trick is to get to the expression
- 16 years later :
  - 3 on pure geometry 
  - 2 on arthmetic 
  - 3 accurate drawing 
  - 3 algebra 
  - 1 on graph drawing 
- Maths being taught to pupils could be regarded as an outcome of an unwritten conspiracy between grammar schools and unis to preserve supply of professional mathematicians and not to worry about any other national needs 
- School Mathematics Project for kids who would not do maths beyong o level but suitable to who takes it further 
- Goal was 
  - school maths more exciting and enjoyable 
  - Impart a knowledge of nature of mathematics and uses to modern world 
  - encourage pupils to pursue further the study of mathematics 
  - bridge gulf between uni and school maths 
  - Reflect changes brought about by increased automation and introduction of computers 
- London Mathematical Society(1995) on the lack of algebraic and manipulative facility among incoming undergraduates 
- Increased emphasis on algbraic structure, definitions and axioms 
- Shift towards Pure Maths with Stats and away from Pure Maths with Mechanics notably among females
- Core maths is half the syllabus-> then can pick whatever they want afterwards
- Restructing of maths in England have had side affects:
  - England and Scotland appear badly but these exclude topic such as statistics and data handling 
  - In Far East good technical competence, high motivation to absorb and regurgitate but poor ability to adapt to situations 
-  Japan : called an increase in time allocated to maths at high school 

##### Technology

- The UK embraced calculators.
- A Level examining boards in maths recommend students have access to scienctific/graphical calculators 
- Algebra packages such as maple, mathematica and derive are common 
- Develop maths as a experimental subjects 
- Techonolgy based developments which include both computer aided learning packages as well as interactive and dynamic teaching materials, have the capability to transform the way pupils understand and learn mathematics.
- The variety of the visual presentation of mathematical knowledge through media instead of one-dimensional world of the textbook will open new horizons for pupils  for all abilities but particully for thouse who find vebally presented data more difficult to comprehend
