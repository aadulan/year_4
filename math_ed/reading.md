# Mathematical Education 

## Week 1 Core Reading 

### Teaching mathematics in secondary schools : a reader

#### Being mathematically educated in the twenty-first century: what should it mean?

##### Introduction

- Mathematics was a subject studied by the elite few
- Nineteenth century (grammar and public schools) only had a small number of children 
  - Maths taught in the class was pure (geometry) | topics that would be useful to a nation of inventors
  - anything above basic education was a waste of resources
- ***Education Act 1870*** - introduced compulsory education until 1988 where a **National Curriculum** was introduced
- 1960s & 1970s -> UK economic interests to have an educated, skilled workforce. Too many people were leaving school both earlier and less well-qualified that contential counterparts. Emerging economies started booming

##### Mathematics in the twentieth century 

- 1900 David Hilbert gave a talk to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris 
  - He discussed 23 unsolved problems he forecast would take attention of mathematicans.
- New topics sprung up in the last century; mathematical statistics, discrete maths and applications, quantum mechanics, chaos and game theory
  - Geometry & analysis have advanced 

##### Some aspects of Mathematics in schools 

Standards of instruction to allow a school to be certified as efficient (1876):

- 50% of people above 7 years old will be tested(in reading, writing & arthmetic)
  - 50% should pass in 2 subjects. 50% should pass in arthemtic 
- 7 - 8 years: form figures up to 20, name at sight figures up to 20, add& subtract figures up to 10, orally and from board
- 8 - 10 years: Simple addition & subtraction of numbers <= figures. Mutliplications tables to 6 
- 10 years +: Short division 
- Looking at how maths was tested at schools from 1933 contained 10 questions. 
  - 3 questions on 'pure' geometry 
  - 2 on pratical arthmetic
  - 1 on scale drawing. graphs, trigonometry, algebraic manipulation, number and proof
- With algbraic manipulation trick is to get to the expression
- 16 years later :
  - 3 on pure geometry 
  - 2 on arthmetic 
  - 3 accurate drawing 
  - 3 algebra 
  - 1 on graph drawing 
- Maths being taught to pupils could be regarded as an outcome of an unwritten conspiracy between grammar schools and unis to preserve supply of professional mathematicians and not to worry about any other national needs 
- School Mathematics Project for kids who would not do maths beyong o level but suitable to who takes it further 
- Goal was 
  - school maths more exciting and enjoyable 
  - Impart a knowledge of nature of mathematics and uses to modern world 
  - encourage pupils to pursue further the study of mathematics 
  - bridge gulf between uni and school maths 
  - Reflect changes brought about by increased automation and introduction of computers 
- London Mathematical Society(1995) on the lack of algebraic and manipulative facility among incoming undergraduates 
- Increased emphasis on algbraic structure, definitions and axioms 
- Shift towards Pure Maths with Stats and away from Pure Maths with Mechanics notably among females
- Core maths is half the syllabus-> then can pick whatever they want afterwards
- Restructing of maths in England have had side affects:
  - England and Scotland appear badly but these exclude topic such as statistics and data handling 
  - In Far East good technical competence, high motivation to absorb and regurgitate but poor ability to adapt to situations 
-  Japan : called an increase in time allocated to maths at high school 

##### Technology

- The UK embraced calculators.
- A Level examining boards in maths recommend students have access to scienctific/graphical calculators 
- Algebra packages such as maple, mathematica and derive are common 
- Develop maths as a experimental subjects 
- Techonolgy based developments which include both computer aided learning packages as well as interactive and dynamic teaching materials, have the capability to transform the way pupils understand and learn mathematics.
- The variety of the visual presentation of mathematical knowledge through media instead of one-dimensional world of the textbook will open new horizons for pupils  for all abilities but particully for thouse who find vebally presented data more difficult to comprehend 

##### Mathematical education in the twenty-first century 

> Majority of people unaware of impact of mathematics through interaction with developing technology

- Lack of sense of what maths can and cannot do means politcal policy makers who take advice on all manner of issues from civil servants using maths models often lack any means of juding whether those models are appropriate or indeed of what questions they should be asking 
- Maths perceived as difficult but as remote in its own language 
- Need it to relate to real people 
- Acquire :
  - basic skills & knowledge for everyday life 
  - development of the ability to think and reason logically 
  - maths models / maths as an language / problem solving 
- Poltical issue with this :
  - deciding what content of apporiate mathematical syllabuses should consist of
  - supply of teachers capable of delivering this mathematics 
  - amount of time devoted to maths within curriculum at different stages
- Less maths teachers 
- Compulsory for everyone till 16
- serious about providing basic skills as well as building the platform that encourages kids to study further -> maths needs to be assigned more time 
- Taiwan schools teach 222 days per year, UK only 190 days 15 hours a week on maths three times as much as UK
- an increase in maths will not happen unless the maths communtiy make a case for learning and appreciating maths that will decrease time spent on other subjects or school day or year needs to be extended 
- Post 16 situation more complex 
  - Maths compulsory part of baccalaureate (hard decding what maths to include)
- Define what mathematically educated means distinguish make math its own disciple part of tradition and maths as a tool of understanding the complex world 

##### Conclusion

- need basic maths as "life skills"
- employers who require technique, knowledge, think logically and to be organised and systematic, policy makers and decsion makers
- Innovation industries driving maths like tech 
- Subject expanding beyond capability of an ordinary person to understand 
- remotness is an obstacle to make person more enganged with maths 
- Maths depends on recuriting students, create a wider understanding on why it should be supported 
- Reliance on computers to give answers without understanding 

### The Elephant in the Classroom

#### What is Maths ?

- ***Reuben Hersh (What is Mathematics Really) *** - People don't like maths because of the way it is mis-represented in school

  - bears little to maths of life & work or even maths with mathematicans do 

- The golden ratio (1.618:1) -> ratio of spirals in seashells,pinecones and pineapples is exactly the same, human body, architecture 

- Most maths students in secondary schools about these relationships and they will not even know they exist.

  - person’s height divided by the distance from tummy button to the floor; or the distance from shoulders to finger-tips, divided by the distance from elbows to finger-tips
  - United Nations Building, the Greek Parthenon, and the pyramids of Egypt

- Illuminating relationships such as thouse found in shapes and in nature 

- Express relations and ideas in numerical, graphical, symbolic, verbal and pictorial forms

- Misled by the image of maths presented in school maths classrooms as not given opportunity to experience real maths 

- School students says maths is 'a list of rules and procdures that need to be remembered'

- Mathematicans often not very good at calculations as they do not feature centrally in their work. Will say 'study of patterns'

- Classrooms should give children a sense of the nature of mathematics 

  ##### Fermat's Last Theorem

  > Theory becam the challenge of centuries. World's greatest Mathematical Problem

  - Got his theory from considering Pythagoras theorem -> school children learn from triangles 
  - Andrew Wiles was the man who solved this 
  - He constructued beautiful new mathmatical methods and relationships
  - Long and complicated problems are important 
    - enocurage persistence,value that is critical for young people to develop and that will stand them in good stead in life and work

- Mathematicans are interviewed often talk about enjoyment in solving difficult problems

- Hard for a school child to enjoy a subject if they experience repeated failure.

- Mathematicans are successful is because they can problem solve 

- Kind of about guessing. Kids at school are surprised as they have learnt to be precise -> don't have a good feel for numbers 

- At school kids learn the methods and how to use them in problems

- Work in collabration not isolation

- maths is all about going from an answer to a question -> requires ingenuity, thinking and creativity

- mathematical methods and relationships known and taught to school children started as questions,  students do not see the questions.  taught content that often appears as a long list of answers to questions that nobody has ever asked

- students need to be given opportunites to ask their own questions and to extend problems in new direction

- Posing and extending problems of interest to students mean they enjoy mathematics more, they feel more ownership of their work and they ultimately learn more.

- Mathematical coursework no longer exists in England as it was decided that it too often led to cheating

  - to use maths in the solving of real and interesting problems

- use of a range of representations such as symbols, words, pictures, tables and diagrams, all used with extreme precision

- For some it is good where there are rules for writing and communicating but for others it is too hard 

- many school approaches is that students should spend years being drilled in a set of methods that they can use later

- mathematicians are most concerned about the students who will enter post-graduate programs in mathematics

- students will encounter real mathematics and use the tools they have learned in school to work in new, interesting and authentic way

- Most will have given up on the subject 

- If they could work like mathematicans, they would see what maths is like, and be given opportunties to enjoy maths and learn it in the most productive way 

  ### Mathematics Teaching 1994 Conference Report

  #### Why do we Teach Mathematics in School?

  ##### Why should this question bother us?

  > Reasons why maths is in the curriculum is different to why it should actually be in the curriculum

  - Seems intellectually unacceptable not to know why we exercise our various professions in mathematics education
  - Need to present agruements to justify mathematics : in front of students, community and society at large
  - Need to think about the purpose, goal and aim of mathematics education we are offering to pupils 

  ##### Types of answers traditionally encountered

  - produce higher emotions & giving mental pleasure 
  - brain development 
  - producing logical ways of thinking 
  - aid given by mathematical weapons on the study of physical sciences 
  - in passing examinations 
  - give men mental tools to use 
  - teaching a man importance of thinking things out for himself
  - making men feel that they know the principles on which it is founded 
  - giving acute philosophical minds a logical counsel of perfection altogether charming and satisfying

  - appreciate greater problems of the worls, the solution of which depends on maths and science 
  - enable each pupil to develop mathematical skill and understanding required for adult life, for employment, for study and training
  - learn a powerful means of communication
  - need to stop teaching maths just because we should 
  - *Utilitarian Arguments*
    - occupational needs
    - coping with everyday private life 
    - prequisties for the study of other subjects
  - *General education Arguments*
    - developing formative capactities eg: logical thinking , analytic, systematic, memory, imagination, clarity and precision of expression, 
    - developing personality and attitudes eg: independent & autonomous thinking and behaviour, problem solving, precision and accuracy, discipline, perservance, confidences 
    - Aesthetic and recreational pleasure 
    - insight into human culture and achievement 
  - Serve society as :
    - demands for labour force in order to further economic/technological development
    - ideology and politics 
    - culture
  - serve individual needs concering 
  -  Socio-economic and occupational welfare 
  - Citizenship & social life 
  - everyday private life 

  - Can create an argument-purpose-matrix (draw please)

    - cells are non-void from both as you can find represented in docs and lit on maths

  - Times and socieities give different weight to cells 

    ##### Attempts to reconstruct society's real reasons for providing maths education to population

    Maths is :

    - a pure science 
    - an applied science which helps understand and develop extra-mathematical matters
    - a system of instruments for practice i.e products and processes that can assist extra- mathematical decisions and actions 
    - a field of aesthetics (beauty,pleasure and excitment)
    -  a teaching subject

  - Maths is unique:

    - has 5 properties at same time 
    - can be used in mutliple areas 
    -  2 maths linked to functioning and development of society at large :
      - other science subjects 
      - speicalised practise areas 
      - general practise areas 

  - Contributes to the shaping of society

  ##### Mathematics education for democracy

  > should provide post-elementary maths ed to all pupils

  - shapes society, mathematical competence tends to be a scarce resource 

  - provide insight into the 'general'

  - Enable, understand and relate to, act on the role of maths 

  - Students should :

    - be able to independently activate & apply maths problems in the real world 
    - Enable to discover, understand and assess others' implicity or explict use of maths in situations 
    - Experience & acquire a feel for range and limitations of application of maths to extra mathematical situations 
    - enable to act with confidence, competence and creativity within universe
    - Communicate with others about mayyers with a mathematical content 
    - acquire understanding of special nature of maths 
    - should acquire some insight in history and development of maths 
    - relations between maths and society 

    ## Week 1 Reccommed Reading 

    ### Curriculum for Excellence - Education Scotland 

    Benchmark for Mathematics (algebra 3- 18 years old):

    - Applies understanding of the equals sign as a balance, and knowledge of number facts, to solve simple algebraic problems where a picture or symbol is used to represent a number, for example,  + 17 = 30 and  × 6 = 30.
    - When a picture or symbol is used to replace a number in a number statement, I can find its value using my knowledge of number facts and explain my thinking to others. 
    - I can apply my knowledge of number facts to solve problems where an unknown value is represented by a symbol or letter. 
    - Solves simple algebraic equations with one variable
    - Expresses sequence rules in algebraic notation, for example, the cost of hiring a car is £75 plus a charge of £0·05 per mile, ‘m’ driven, C = 0.05m + 75.
    -  Collects like terms, including squared terms, to simplify an algebraic expression.  Evaluates expressions involving two variables using both positive and negative numbers.  Solves linear equations, for example, ax ± b = c where a, b and c are integers.  Creates a simple linear formula representing information contained in a diagram, problem or statement.  Evaluates a simple formula, for example, C = 0.05m + 75.
    - Expands brackets using the distributive law and simplifies.  Solves an extended range of linear equations involving the distributive law, for example, ax ± b = cx ± d, where a, b, c and d are integers.  Solves linear inequalities, including on simple closed intervals.  Solves problems by expressing the given information appropriately as an equation, in-equation or formula.  Evaluates algebraic expressions involving a bracket.  Factorises expressions with a numeric common factor.

  

  ## Week 2 Core Reading 

  ### How children learn mathematics: a guide for parents and teachers

  #### Piaget's Interviews with Children 

  > Tests took the form of an interview conducted with indvidual children. designed tests for conservation of number, length, capacity and weight 

  Testing the ability to link pairing and cardinal number. Testing length conservation by moving two sticks to see if they think it has changed 

  #### Piaget's Immutable Sequence of Development

  > bulit a theory of cognitive development, development of knowledge by children, passed through a sequence of stage

  - Grouped stages into four periods of development with a child's congnitive growth

  - *Period 1* (birth to 18 months) - sensori motor

    - Learns to associate sensation with action
    - Learns the concept of permanence of objects 
    - Maturer baby learns things exist when you can't see it, also learns the concept of reversibility

  - *Period 2* (18 months - 7 yrs) intuitive

    - (18 months - 4 yrs): 
      - Representation: using words to represent objects, relations between objects
      - Perception develops 
    - (4 - 7 yrs):
      - Confident that the world is as he perceives it 
      - More numerous, doesn't have the concept of horizontal yet
      - Percepetion is egocentric (cannot see anything from another viewpoint)
      - Solve problems by empirical tests instead of logical relations
      - Conflicts between perception and reasoning, understood number conservation
      - able to think two criteria simultaneously 

  - *Period 3* (7 - 12 yrs) concrete operational

    - improves logic to physical situations 
    - builds mental structures to generalize physical situations 
    - Concept of reversilibity deepens 
    - can make transitive inferences 

  - *Period 4* (12 yrs+) formal operational

    - ability to agrue from abstract hypothesis and to make deductions on basis of logic 

    #### Immutable Chain of Development 

    > Periods of cognitive growth include many stages which kids pass through in precisely the same order

    - attain conservation of number, length, capactiy and weight in that order 
    - won't attain 'horizontal' before 'parallel'
    - no amount of teaching can accelerate this 

    #### Challenges of Piaget's Theory 

    1. order of development is not invariant for every child 
       -  Studies show some African children develop number concepts at a later stage than European but develop concept of horizontal much earlier 
    2. development can be acclerated by teaching 
       - Conservation of liquid 
         - child who recognized reversibility of pouring will say yes 
         - Bruner said not only principle involved as y contained same amount as x, z must contain same amount as x 
         - Non conservers would agree with first part of agrument
    3. severely underrates the powers of inference of young children 
       - Piaget said children unable to do this until concerte operational period 
       - Bryant and Trabasso performed an experiment to show 4 year old can do this 
       - Inference than egocentric perception that causes children to draw water parallel to base of jar
    4. pays insufficient attention to the way in which young children interpret language
       - Maraget Donaldson, tester rather than child who exhibits egocentricity
       - shouldn't assume child uses certain words, they understand it in same sense that adults do , comprehension comes after use
       - Childen intrepret what is said by gestures and facial expressions. Failure occures more likely to be because of interpretaion than of reasoning 
       - Failure is an inability to abstract language from its context

    - Ability of abstract language from context is what is required maths 

    ##### Conclusions 

    > Drawn our attention to behaviour that is characteristic of child after children

    ### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp) 

    #### Chapter 7 : Formation of Mathematical Concepts 

    #### Abstracting and Classifying 

    > Children have classification of their previous experience, fitting of their present experience into one of these classes. Everyone does this 

    - Classify every time we recognise an object as one which we have seen before 
    - Varying inputs -> invariant properties - can tell the similarties a lot easier than differences 
    - Concepts require a number of experiences which have something in common, once formed we talk about examples of the concept
    - objects that stand out from surroundings are more liekly to be remembered 

    ##### Communication of concepts 

    > language used to speed up making a concept by helping to collect and separate examples and non-examples 

    - usually in maths this is what is done 
    - Trying to describe red 
      - wavelength - doesn't actually mean anything 
      - showing what is red is more understandable (auxiliary)

    - Sensory and motor experience of the outside world **(primary concepts)** . Ones that are abstracted are **(secondary concepts)**
    - Order between concepts and a conceptual hierachy makes us understand more why some concepts can only be formed once others have formed
    - Definitions can be seen as a way of adding precison to the boundaries of a concept
    - Commuication of maths is more difficult on paert of communicator and receiver. 
      - concepts of a higher order in a hierachy than those which a person already has cannot be communicated by definition can now be deduced 

  ##### The learning of Mathematical Concepts

  > everyday knowledge is learnt directly from our enivronment and concepts involved are not very abstract

  - Maths cannot be learnt directly from the everyday environment but indirectly from other mathematicans. Dependence of teachers and can cause fear and dislike of maths
  - The communicator of ideas is who needs to know them
  - Concepts of a higher order than those which a person already has cannot be communicated to him by definition, but only arranging for him to encounter a suitable collection of examples
  - Maths, examples are almost invariably other concepts, must ensure these are formed in mind of learner 
  - first is broken is majority of textbooks. New topics are introduced by definitions not examples 
    - examples must have common properties to form the concept, must be alike so can be abstracted.
  - Before we try to introduce a concept, we need to find out what its contributory concept are until we reach primary concepts. then a suitable plan can be made
  - problem with this is if you don't fully understand something you won't get the higher concepts (important in maths)
  - in physics you can understand heat and light without knowing about sound, maths you can't understand algebra without arithmetic.
  - Students learn manipulations with a imperfect understanding of underlying principles. 
  - all subsequent concepts may not be understood. Depends on the learner and level of comprehension
  - contributory concepts needed for each new stage of abstraction must be available. 

  ##### Learning and Teaching

  > create concepets in our mind, only able to do this by using concepts arrived at by past mathematicans

  - dependent on good teaching in early stages 
  - to know maths is different to teaching it (communicating at a lower conceptual level)

  ### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp) 

  #### Chapter 2 : The Idea of a Schema 

  - Given a collection not of a single object but *pairs* of objects, we can become aware of something in common between the pairs 
  - Order & equivalence relations have important properties
  - Study of structures is important in maths & study of ways in which they are bulit and function is core of psychology of learning maths 

##### The Integrative function of a schema 

> recognize something as an example of a concept we become aware of it in two levels : itself and as a member of this class 

- class concept is linked by our mental schema with lots of other concepts, avaliable to help us behave adaptively to the situation of that object
- *More schemas we have available, better chance of coping with unexpected*

##### The Schema as a tool for further learning 

> almost every we learn depends on knowing something else

- schematically learnt material was not only better, also better retained 
- learning schematically, learning in a efficient way, preparing a mental tool for applying the same thing to future tasks in that field 
- if task in isolation, schematic learning can take longer (solving equations - remebering rules a lot easier to do it than understanding the rules for the future)
- New experience which fits into exisiting schema is a lot better remembered, what doesn't fit into it a lot isn't really learn and what is learnt temporarily is soon forgotten
- Schema seems very adaptable but may not be depending on the situation. Schemas need to be able to change their structure, reconstruction is sometimes require before new situation is understood. if it fails, new expereince cannot be interpreted and individual cannot cope
- Basic mathematical schema is natural number system (with + and  $\times$)  bring in fractions and that's another one as multiplication cannot be considered as repeated addition , number schema needs to go under reconsturction 
- some people go through without understanding fractions
- diffciulty of reconstructing a schema:
  - Hindu-arabic system of numerals for natural numbers met with great resistance when introduced into Europe, some made it illegal

##### Understanding 

> To understand something means to assimilate it into an appropriate schema 

- Better internal organization of a schema can help improve understanding 

- rule with explanation is always better than just giving the rule.

##### Implications for the learning of mathematics 

> central importance of the schema as aa tool of learning means that inappropriate early schemas will make the assimilation of later ideas much more difficult, perhaps impossible 

- test adaptability of learner is to give them new mathematically related situations 
- Bright children can memorize a lot, apperance of learning maths can be matained until a level is reached at which true conceptual learning is adequate to the situation 
- an apporiate schema is one which takes into account the long term learning task and not immediate one 
- equations : based on the idea of a pair of scales . but cannot do it for quadractics etc 
- sometimes hard to choose between short-term inital schema and harder long-term one 
- responsibility of teachers in early stages of learning is high; make sure that schematic learning, not memorizing manipluation of symbols is taking places
  - need to think about what stages require straightforward assimilation and when reconstruction is needed 
  - help pupils find patterns, teach them to look and teach them to be able to reconstruct 

### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp)

#### Chapter 12 Relational Understanding and Instrumental Understanding

Haven't been able to read this, can't get it online 

## Week 3 Core Reading 

### Learning to teach in the primary school

#### Chapter 2.2 Looking at Learning

##### Introduction

> natrual process that we do everyday, understanding how we learn is not as straightforward

> learning is a relatively persistent change in an individual's possible behaviour due to experience 

##### Behaviourism 

> reaction against the introspective psychology.

- **Knowledge**:
  - repertoire of behaviours, knowledge is action
  - set of passive, mechanical responses to environmental stimuli 
- **Learning**:
  - Info from teacher -> learner : trasmission of response appopriate to certain stimulus 
  - point of education is to present the learner with appropriate repertoire of behavioural responses to specific stimuli & reinforce responses through an effective reinforcement schedule
  - -> requires consistent repetition of materal , should be small progressive tasks & continious positive reinforcement should be given, without this, learned responses will quickly become extinct, learner continue to modify behaviour until they receive positive reinforcement 
- **Motivation**:
  - pleaseant experiences cause human learners to make desired connections between specific stimuli & appropriate responses
- **Teaching**:
  - `skill` or `drill` exercises to provided the consistent repetition for effective reinforcement of response patterns
  - postitive reinforcement 
  - questions (stimulus) & answer (response) sequences, in which questions are of gradually increasing difficulty, guided practice and regular reviews of material . 
  - Use tests and examinations to measure degree of learning 
  - Proved most succesful where there is a correct response or easily memorised material. Usefulness in teaching comprehension and composition is questionable 

##### Constructivism

> knowledge comprises symbolic mental representations such as propositions and images, together with mechanism. Actively constructed by learners, based on their existing cognitive structures 

- Jean Piaget said learning is a dynamic process comprising successive stages of adaptation to reality, learners construct knowledge by creating & testing own theories of world
  - basic principle -> principle of equilibration (balancing) : cognitive development progress towards complex, but stable mental representations of the world
  - humans have been resistant to new ideas as they have inbulity need for stability 
- learners adapt and develop by assimilating and accommodating new information into existing cognitive structures 
- **Knowledge**:
  - Actively constructed by learners, any account of knowledge makes essential references to cognitive structures within learner's mind
  - complex set of mental representaions derived from past learning experiences,interprets experiences and info in light of existing knowledge, stage of cognitive development, cultural background, personal history and so on
- **Learning**:
  - learning is a process of active discovery
  - role of teacher is to faciliate discovery, by providing resources & guiding learners attempt to assimilate new knowledge
- **Motivation**:
  - Learners must face up to limitations of their own knowledge and accept need to modify or abandon existing beliefs
- **Teaching**:
  - Importance of strategies to help learns assimilate and accomadate new material
  - practical acitivity, physical manipulation of objects 

##### Social Constructivism

> Emphasis that collabroative nature of learning, process by which learners were integrated into a knowledge community 

- **Knowledge**:
  - language & culture in cognitive development important to how humans perceive the world 
  - Framework of how humans experience, communicate and understand reality
- **Learning**:
  - Actual development : learner capable of solving problems independly 
  - Potential development: learner capable under guidance of teachers or in collaboration with peers
- **Motivation:**
  - Both extrinsic and intrinsic, partially motivated by rewards provided by the knowledge community
- **Teaching**:
  - Develop team work skills, all about team work

### Teaching Mathematics

#### Being Mathematical within a mathematical community

##### Constructivism

> perspective on knowledge and learning which suggests that any person's knowledge is not acquired from outside but constructed by that individual 

- learn by adapting what they know to fit with what they experience in the world around them 
- implication of this belief is that not possible to say something to someone else and expect them to understand exactly the meaning that was intended to be conveyed 

##### Making models 

- different images can contribute to similar models , people's perception of others can be so different to my own
- models can be adapted from interaction and discussion with others in the group

##### Being Mathematical

- idea was to see how people think and they decided to bring in mathematics 
- spotted patterns and tried to express the generalities which they could see

##### A Mathematical Community 

> need to communicate mathematical ideas and contrast ways of seeing mathematics in different communities to reach common ground 

- encourages individual constructing of mathematical ideas and fosters negotiation & social mediation which leads to shared meanings being developed 

##### In the Classroom

- **Pythagoras Theorem:**
  - With disucssions able to think about using fractional numbers not just whole numbers
- **Area or Perimeter:**
  - desicribe what they saw 
  - respect ideas 
- **Differentiation:**
  - learn the value of articulating what they think they know 

##### Being a mathematican

- Individual construction of mathematical knowledge 
- to be a mathematican is to mathematisie a situation created 
- dicussing ideas like this reinforces this as concepts are developed 

### Teaching Mathematics: action and awareness

#### Interlude: On readiness and fading 

> foolish to attempt to teach an idea if is not accessible, little point in wasting time and energy

- Child expose to adult conversation, vocab and thinking process develop more quickly 

- deciding on readiness and abilities of individual pupils and labelling can mean shutting onself off from seeing other strenghts and potential development.

- Desire to simplify the design of instruction, can result in failure to stimulate challenge and extend pupils sufficiently thereby inhibiting rather than promoting learning, can cut them off from experience why lay foundation for future readiness

- children go through periods of behaviour patterns,despite repeated correction or criticism, appear to disregard completely differently,

- Maria Montessori in Italy reccommended offering children opportunties, if not taken up she advocated exposure to those same opportunties at intervals until they did

- education is reconstruction of accumlated experience by each individual, teacher role is to provide opportunties and stimulate the reconstruction

- Many teaching projects said if pupil did not respond as wanted, they were not ready 

  - tasks classified according to stage and were assigned levels for the national curriculum 

- Lev Vygotsky offered a persoective which makes readiness a more useful idea 

- role of language in learning and social role of people was important

- higher psychological functions such as performing complex tasks & monitoring what is doing are derived from others in observing social interactions. pupils need to talk about their thinking 

- Zone of proximal development : sensitivities to readiness to develop 

- saffolding -> assistance that a teacher gives, gradually withdrawn  as pupil is able to function independly 

  ## Week 4 Core Reading

  ### Effective Teachers of Numeracy in Primary Schools: Teachers' Beliefs, Practices and Pupils' Learning.

  > Study examining links between teachers' practices, beliefs and knowledge and pupil learning outcomes in numeracy 5yrs to 11



- **Identifying effective teachers of numeracy:**

  - effective teachers who bring about identified learning outcomes ( looking at evidence of increases in pupil attainment)
  - Tests were given to classes at beginning and end, average gains were calculated  to provide a `teacher effectiveness`
  - Teachers were groupled in highly effective, effective, moderately effective. Done by ranking average gains 

- **Teacher case Study Data:**

  - Research on the links between knowledge, beliefs and practice suggested a mix of techniques to elicit teachers' knowledge and understanding backed up by classroom observation to examine actual practices.

- **Clasroom Observations:**

  - 54 lessons observed, looking at pupil responses, teaching resources, teaching styles, organisational and management strategies

- **Case study teacher interviews:** 

  - *background*: provide evidence of training & experience, beliefs, knowledge,practises in teaching numeracy, why they are successful 
  - *concept mapping*: task explored teachers understanding aspects of maths related to teaching numeracy
  - *personal construct*: task focused on particular group of pupils that teacher was currently teaching in order to explore beliefs & knowledge about pupils 

- **Orientation in teachers beliefs:**

  - connectionist - beliefs based around both valuing pupils' methods and teaching strategies with an emphasis on establishing connections within mathematics
  - transmission - beliefs based around the primacy of teaching and a view of mathematics as a collection of separate routines and procedures
  - discovery- beliefs clustered around the primacy of learning and a view of mathematics as being discovered by pupils
  - **teachers with a strong connectionist orientation were more likely to have classes that made greater gains over the two terms than those classes of teachers with strong discoveryor transmission orientations**

- **Links between orientation and practice:**

  - all saw mental maths important, basic number bonds, multiplication facts provide baseline 
  - connectionist orientated saw mental maths as beyond recall of facts, have awarness of connections, relationship to develop mental agility
  - development of flexible mental strategies to handle efficiently number calculations
  - laid foundations that extended the pupils' levels of competency
  - tackle calculations for which methods had not been taught
  - connectionist emphasis on challenging all pupils, had high expectations for everyone regarless of ability, others did maths different for lower attaining pupils 
  - connectionist had discussions between teacher, pupils, groups or individually, saw importance of compuntational skills, did not see pre-requiste that pupils should learnt a skill in advance of being able to apply
  -  *discovery* or *transmission* orientated teachers, application of knowledge involved pupils putting what they had previously learnt into context

  ### Teaching Mathematics in secondary schools

  #### Open and closed mathematics approaches

  ##### Introduction

  > growing concern that students cannot use maths learnt at school, in situations outside the classroom 

  - led to decrease in `drill and practise` to `lets problem solve`
  - reccommed students given open-ended, practical and investigative work which requires them to make their own deccision, plan routes, choose methods, apply their mathematical knowledge

  ##### The Two Schools

  > teaching methods were different, but student intake were very similar 

  - **Amber Hill School:**
    - teachers show methods and procedures on the board, and pupils work through textbook for remainder of the class apart of last two weeks where they were given open ended project
    - Students grouped in eight sets based on ability all were extremely motivated 
    - Find lessons borning and tedious 
  - **Rule following behaviour:**
    - students viewed maths was all about memorising a vast number if rules,formulas and equations, thought it was wrong to think about how to solve the problem 
    - students were not encouraged to discuss rules or methods or think about why they were useful, did not know when situations were mathmatically similar 
  - **Cue based behaviour:**
    - based mathematical thinking what they thought was expected, rather than maths in a question 
    - used non-mathematical cues as indicators of teachers' and textbooks intentions 
      - related to word of teacher, use cues as expected diffciulty of question, context of question, teachers info when talking to them 
      - Schornfield  asserts this from response to conventional pedagogic practise in math that demonstrate set routines that should be learnt
  - **Phonenix Park School** :
    - encouraged to take responsibilty and be independent thinkers 
    - worked on open-ended projects in mixed ability groups  until jan when they started practising exam technique 
    - If they needed maths they did not know, teacher would teach it 
    - found it intresting, good atmosphere and noisy 
  - **Student Assessment:**
    - Year 9 and 10 gave students an applied task & short written test which assessed all maths they would need for task
    - on the test both schools were fine 
    - phonenix were better at applied task
  - **Discussion**:
    - Amber hill students developed an inert knowledge that they found difficult using anything but textbook, did not know how to apply methods 
    - Perceiving and interpretation of situations that seemed to be different 

### The Elephant in the Classroom

#### Chapter 2 : What's going wrong in classrooms?

##### Identifying the Problem 

- desire to label students, assign a level, prejudge their achievement 
- some think role is to find people really good at maths & give rest lower skilled work
- Schools in England do this constantly, now decideding which children can & cannot do math at 4 years old. 
- children develop at different rates, reveal different interests, strengths & dispositions at different stages of development
- should provide stimulating envirnoments for all children, where intrests can be peaked and nurtured
- difficult to do so, if they are placed in a low group at an early age
- no longer learn maths to develop problem-solving skills or to appreciate patterns & connections or even express relationships & ideas using forms. learn to get a qualification. Uk dropped from 8th to 24th
- high acheivers in maths think they should choose maths for further study because they can do it. When they reach uni everyone is at the same level, start to question whole purpose

##### Learning without thought?

> traditional vs progressive teaching

- in maths, stand at front of class, students copy methods and then work through identical questions - forced in a passive relationship, find it hard to use method in new situation, they think all they need to do is memorize
- students want to know why they are learning it 
- learn to suppress their thoughts, ideas and problem-solving abilities 

##### Learning without Talking 

> students don't discuss maths in classes, sit in slience instead

- students sometimes need to talk through methods, to know if they understand them, if you explain something, you understand it 
- Need to talk about maths rather than listen. Listening doens't mean you understand it 
- some students think they get it when methods are shown to them, difference between seeing it make sense and understanding it 
- Reasoning is important in maths - understanding why- can't do this in slience 
- when they offer a soloution, they should know why and explain the rules and principles why, discussing allows them to learn maths is their own ideas and perspectives 
- seeing things in other people's perspectives allows you to reconstruct the idea and deepens understanding

##### Learning without reality

> students think they have to leave common sense land to do maths 

### Teaching Mathematics in secondary schools 

#### Maximising energy in the learning of mathematics 

##### Working Creatively

> All children bring the ability to work **creatively** in mathematics 

- thinking & behaving creatively is an increasingly important skill in the world of technology 

- Need a supply of mathematically lierate people

  - in UK at present, of supply  in some doubt 

- loss of creative approach to maths occurs early in pupil's experience of learning maths 

  - Comparing secondary school and primary school - younger pupils were willing & able to attack the problem
  - assumed if they were given a task, then they would be able to make some progress 
  - secondary school pupils prep material for them, looking for intresting ways to apporach ideas , each week had to accept material was too demanding, not in content but in terms of demands to be relatively autonomous learners 
  - caused by teacher behaviour and expectation - made them dependent learners 

- ↑ in the % of young people going to university must be a factor, clear many find the tranisiton to uni a traumatic one 

- Maths grads voulable about difficulties they experienced adjusting to their degree courses 

- Teachers have trouble trying to put in high energy due to them not having it either 

  #### What is lacking?

  - subject to many studies, conflicting with each other 
  - bottom up curriculum - designed to meet for its priority needs of the average, and below average pupil
  - intro to curriculum of investigations ->

- **Pace**

  - 'understanding of difficultly' has led to loss of a sense of urgency to progress
  - is to do with energy expanding in understanding 

- **Know-how**

  - to teach through memory and not understanding 

- **Investigations,conjecturing and Proving**

  - needs to be centerb of learning process
  - not intergated well 

- **Struggle**

  - many texts have been developed over 10 years to make it easier 
  - hope to help pupils enjoy maths easier 
  - don't see overall picture, retains info less well because deeper parts of brain do not engage
  - to internalise a concept in maths need to engage with it in some real sense, need to articulate and reflectupon it to relate it to other ideas 
  - need excitment to struggled

- **Challenging some assumptions about teaching**

  - **importance of getting right answers**
    - hard to erdicate -> pupils get tested by performance of techniques 
    - teachers feel happy when children get it right 
    - don't dig deeper and look for lack of understanding 
    - need to help develop strategies to work with difficult ideas 
    - need to find it statisfying if they are to value their progress 
    - need to learn to probe understanding, uncover lack of clarity & misconceptions even if they don't like results 
  - **teaching as explaining**
    - main tasks of a teacher is to explain maths to pupils so they understand it
    - Characteristics of a good maths teaching -> talk about patience & humour, some say need ability to give multiple explanations of the same thing
    - Can sepeate into 2 things -> arbitrary (standard notation,definitions)
    - second is things that can be deduced from earlier knowledgeor by working logically with 
    - to explain in non abritary way is to risk creating dependency on the teaching 
    - Teach without telling process in which students contributions are valued as they led to ask their own questions, teachers can often assist pupils to move forward by asking them to review it
    - makes have their own confidence, need to work out when to withhold information 

- **mathematical ethos**

  - **learning takes time**
    - teachers don't teach, create a situation in which pupils may learn
    - will take time to come with terms with ideas and can relate to children 
  - **Reflection**
    - need to give time to help pupils trace ideas back to link them to previous experiences and to draw out commonalities
  - **Fluency and Practise**
    - failure of fluency can cause much loss of energy
    - cause a delay in progress 
    - power of games cause a unreasonable amount of practise
    - need to allow them to search of a general structure 
  - **Conjecturing**
    - involves pupils in the evaluation of ideas 
    - embodies ideas for justification, allows people to contribute
  - **Know-how versus memorisation**
    - students become memorizers 
    - using all there attention to hold on to rules 
  - **An Internal Monitor**
    - need to support the development of conceptual structures by highlighting interconnections of ideas
  - **Confidence and Power**
    - need to create confidence to help

  

## Week 5 Core Reading 

### How Interactive is your whiteboard?

> interactive whole class teaching is the 'heart' of effective practise

- the emphasis on maintaining a brisk pace and allowing pupils time to think through their answers; • the emphasis on the need to build on pupils’ methods and the need to meet specific teaching objectives; • the emphasis on rapid recall of facts and using pupil errors constructively; • time for personal reflection on what has been learnt and fast, lively interactive teaching.
- focus on mini-white boards or inviting children out to the board, rather than thinking about complex issues 
- children do need time to think and refelct and think of better answers and this interactivity might  not allow them to get there 
- does allow more interaction between student and teacher 
- 

![image-20191012120144334](/Users/asmitadulan/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20191012120144334.png)ask a question that encourages pupils to explain their ideas rather than simply funnel the discussion towards the answer in your head? • allow pupils time to think before demanding a response? • ask a question that is sufficiently complex to require thinking time? • encourage pupils to make public statements of more than 10 words? • encourage pupils to speak in a discussion for more than 5 seconds? • build on a pupil’s answer rather than simply assess it? • follow a pupil’s line of thinking for a while? • encourage pupils to reflect on their learning at the end of a lesson, summarising the key points for themselves?

- research into impact of traditional format still dominates 
- Teachers are asking more questions - answers are very short though 
- tend to evaluate rather than extend or build on pupils responses to questions 
- Need a degree of personal engagement or depth of understanding 
- must interact with teaching in meaningful manner, need to be able to exchange, not just act of passive recipents 

#### Superficial or deep interactivity 

- form of whole class teaching with the lowest of interaction are lectures 

- scaffolding is restricted 

- Funnelling 

  - teacher who selects the thinking strategy and controls the decision making process as questions lead students along a certain path 

- probing questions allow deeper evaulation of pupils thinking 

- focusing questions control the general direction, draws attention of class to aspects of pupils contributions that are important - need high level of skill and confidences from teachers who think on their feet 

- Collective Reflection : interaction based on evaulation and reflection 

- move towards teaching approaches involve depper interaction and collective reflection would lead to improved learning 

  ### Interactive whiteboards 

- ICT has the potential to promote pupil autonomy in learning, difficult has been integrating ICT within traditional apporaches that are often largely teacher centred

- Lecturing has used powerpoints -> presentational tool

- Interactivity here depends on individual teaching approaches 

- Having programs such as graph plotting allows pupils to experiment on what would happen- allows dicussion 

### Role of the Calculator in learning Mathematics 

- CAN (Calculator-Aware Number) explored impact of calculator use on primary schools pupils 
- CAN Children competed to develop a wide range of strategies 
- More willing to attemp questions and work independtly 
- CPM 
  - to discover patterns 
  - a number cruchcer 
  - recording and manipluating numbers 
  - object for discovery 
- they did not become more reliant on calculators 
- teachers more reliant on discussions 
- Pupils who used calculators out performed students who didn't, also had more postive attuide towards maths 
- Wales - no difference was found 
- often allowd to check if answers are right, can provide instant, provate feedback, so pupils can be reassured 
- A cructh to avoid learning
  - can perform calculation but does nothing for math development 
  - inhibits mental stragies to think 
- scaffolding to assist learning 
  - need to underpin concepts 
  - can help students focus on the more important concepts rather than arithmetic 
- a window into maths 
  - explore maths which they may not see 
- a tool for thinking 
  - enable to extend maths c oncepts 
  - abstraction and generalization
    - use to generate data quickly 
  - graphical representation
    - can plot graphs, can explore values very quickly 
  - Programming
    - if they want to program they need to understand the math well and to think logically 



## Week 7 Reading 

### Teaching Mathematics in Secondary Schools 

#### What does it mean to understand something and how do we know when it has happened?

> knowing and understanding have different meanings 

##### Understanding as a state

- common for new teachers to say they only understood something when they had to teach it 
- thinking involved in planning to teach enabled teacher to revaluate and look at it in a more deeper way, more connected 
- Marton and Saljo classify learning as 
  - surface : learning procedures, and descriptions
  -  deep learning : about connections and relationships with previous descriptions 
- learning maths involves connecting and employing learnt procedures
- most math peeps don't explain themselves 
- a state of understanding would include facts and figures 

##### Understanding as meaning and connection 

- skemp points out knowing what is approaite to do and when to do it, involves a different kind of understanding than knowing how to do it 
- Insturmental undertsanding vs relational understanding 
- meanings pupils develop about a concept, relationships and reasons they attach to it are inevitable.
- give alternative ways to remeber things 

##### Growth of understanding 

- everything is connected 
- Primitive knoweldge is what is known so far, making distinctions, and using it in new ways 

##### Understanding in context 

- need to be able to apply in real life situations 

##### Understanding as overcoming obstacles 

- overcoming of particular obscatles in mathematics 
- misunderstandings 

##### what teachers mean by understanding 

- can say in own words
- tell me how they did it 
- reconginse abilities to generalise, represent etc 

##### how do we know pupils understand 

- wriiten work, oral understanding etc we need more to show pupils understand 

##### Assesment 

- find out something about the pupils state of knowlege in order to decide what and how to teach 
- formative assesment can motivate pupils but takes away that deeper understanding 

##### methods of assemesnet 

- is the concept used where apporpitate 
- has it been adapted for use 
- explain 
- tests
- analyssi 
- activites 

## Semester 2 - Week 2 Reading

### Debates in mathematics education - Chapter 1

> ability thinking is how mathematics is taught and learnt

- each person has a particular level of math ability that is relatively stable 
- Entity that help determine how much mathematics, how fast an individual can learn
- learners with similar levels of attainment so assumed ability are best taught together
- primary schhols use within class ability grouping or setting 

#### Ability thinking

> people can fixed view of mathematicalability
>
> each person has an underlying level of what mathematical ability they have and this contributes to how well they can learn maths 

- sets in class, likely shaped in your beleif 
- fixed view in balance with 'inborn intelligence'
- with practise people can improve test scores
- what people can do in everyday is very different to knowlege they display in formal school enivormnets 
- attainment on maths tests is not only determined by how much maths is known but by physical well being, level of motivation, general test-taking , emotional issues and revision
- current curriculum tends to be shaped by what can be easily tested rather than reflecting diverse ways maths is used in society or important ascpects of math activity
- labels can dertime what they end up being 
- lowers students expectations & learners are not the same

#### Setting and attainment

- teaching students in sets - dominant form of organisation for maths lessons in most secondary schools in the UK for a long time
- government encourage approaches like this 
- counties such as Finland teach maths in all attainment groups, true of other highly ranked European countires 

#### Setting practises and teaching 

- cultural sterotypes 
- students from groups who experience social and economic disadvantage are more likely to be found in the lower sets 
- in top sets assumption is evidence suggests that many learners benefit from or  need a face pace and insturmental proficiency. In particular girls are alienated in this enviornment 
- lower sets in secondary schools will often only be offered material that they have previously encountered and so meet a narrow and restricted curriculum

#### Ability Mindsets

- create barriers and can have profound impacts on learners beliefs about maths 

#### Alternative Mindsets 

- high expectatuons of all students 
- allow all to access a challenge curriculum
- valuinh current effort rather than previous attainment 
- striving for the achievement of all rathe than of a few
