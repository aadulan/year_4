## Week 1 Core Reading 

### Teaching mathematics in secondary schools : a reader

#### Being mathematically educated in the twenty-first century: what should it mean?

##### Introduction

- Mathematics was a subject studied by the elite few
- Nineteenth century (grammar and public schools) only had a small number of children 
  - Maths taught in the class was pure (geometry) | topics that would be useful to a nation of inventors
  - anything above basic education was a waste of resources
- ***Education Act 1870*** - introduced compulsory education until 1988 where a **National Curriculum** was introduced
- 1960s & 1970s -> UK economic interests to have an educated, skilled workforce. Too many people were leaving school both earlier and less well-qualified that contential counterparts. Emerging economies started booming

##### Mathematics in the twentieth century 

- 1900 David Hilbert gave a talk to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris 
  - He discussed 23 unsolved problems he forecast would take attention of mathematicans.
- New topics sprung up in the last century; mathematical statistics, discrete maths and applications, quantum mechanics, chaos and game theory
  - Geometry & analysis have advanced 

##### Some aspects of Mathematics in schools 

Standards of instruction to allow a school to be certified as efficient (1876):

- 50% of people above 7 years old will be tested(in reading, writing & arthmetic)
  - 50% should pass in 2 subjects. 50% should pass in arthemtic 
- 7 - 8 years: form figures up to 20, name at sight figures up to 20, add& subtract figures up to 10, orally and from board
- 8 - 10 years: Simple addition & subtraction of numbers <= figures. Mutliplications tables to 6 
- 10 years +: Short division 
- Looking at how maths was tested at schools from 1933 contained 10 questions. 
  - 3 questions on 'pure' geometry 
  - 2 on pratical arthmetic
  - 1 on scale drawing. graphs, trigonometry, algebraic manipulation, number and proof
- With algbraic manipulation trick is to get to the expression
- 16 years later :
  - 3 on pure geometry 
  - 2 on arthmetic 
  - 3 accurate drawing 
  - 3 algebra 
  - 1 on graph drawing 
- Maths being taught to pupils could be regarded as an outcome of an unwritten conspiracy between grammar schools and unis to preserve supply of professional mathematicians and not to worry about any other national needs 
- School Mathematics Project for kids who would not do maths beyong o level but suitable to who takes it further 
- Goal was 
  - school maths more exciting and enjoyable 
  - Impart a knowledge of nature of mathematics and uses to modern world 
  - encourage pupils to pursue further the study of mathematics 
  - bridge gulf between uni and school maths 
  - Reflect changes brought about by increased automation and introduction of computers 
- London Mathematical Society(1995) on the lack of algebraic and manipulative facility among incoming undergraduates 
- Increased emphasis on algbraic structure, definitions and axioms 
- Shift towards Pure Maths with Stats and away from Pure Maths with Mechanics notably among females
- Core maths is half the syllabus-> then can pick whatever they want afterwards
- Restructing of maths in England have had side affects:
  - England and Scotland appear badly but these exclude topic such as statistics and data handling 
  - In Far East good technical competence, high motivation to absorb and regurgitate but poor ability to adapt to situations 
-  Japan : called an increase in time allocated to maths at high school 

##### Technology

- The UK embraced calculators.
- A Level examining boards in maths recommend students have access to scienctific/graphical calculators 
- Algebra packages such as maple, mathematica and derive are common 
- Develop maths as a experimental subjects 
- Techonolgy based developments which include both computer aided learning packages as well as interactive and dynamic teaching materials, have the capability to transform the way pupils understand and learn mathematics.
- The variety of the visual presentation of mathematical knowledge through media instead of one-dimensional world of the textbook will open new horizons for pupils  for all abilities but particully for thouse who find vebally presented data more difficult to comprehend 

##### Mathematical education in the twenty-first century 

> Majority of people unaware of impact of mathematics through interaction with developing technology

- Lack of sense of what maths can and cannot do means politcal policy makers who take advice on all manner of issues from civil servants using maths models often lack any means of juding whether those models are appropriate or indeed of what questions they should be asking 
- Maths perceived as difficult but as remote in its own language 
- Need it to relate to real people 
- Acquire :
  - basic skills & knowledge for everyday life 
  - development of the ability to think and reason logically 
  - maths models / maths as an language / problem solving 
- Poltical issue with this :
  - deciding what content of apporiate mathematical syllabuses should consist of
  - supply of teachers capable of delivering this mathematics 
  - amount of time devoted to maths within curriculum at different stages
- Less maths teachers 
- Compulsory for everyone till 16
- serious about providing basic skills as well as building the platform that encourages kids to study further -> maths needs to be assigned more time 
- Taiwan schools teach 222 days per year, UK only 190 days 15 hours a week on maths three times as much as UK
- an increase in maths will not happen unless the maths communtiy make a case for learning and appreciating maths that will decrease time spent on other subjects or school day or year needs to be extended 
- Post 16 situation more complex 
  - Maths compulsory part of baccalaureate (hard decding what maths to include)
- Define what mathematically educated means distinguish make math its own disciple part of tradition and maths as a tool of understanding the complex world 

##### Conclusion

- need basic maths as "life skills"
- employers who require technique, knowledge, think logically and to be organised and systematic, policy makers and decsion makers
- Innovation industries driving maths like tech 
- Subject expanding beyond capability of an ordinary person to understand 
- remotness is an obstacle to make person more enganged with maths 
- Maths depends on recuriting students, create a wider understanding on why it should be supported 
- Reliance on computers to give answers without understanding 

### The Elephant in the Classroom

#### What is Maths ?

- ***Reuben Hersh (What is Mathematics Really) *** - People don't like maths because of the way it is mis-represented in school

  - bears little to maths of life & work or even maths with mathematicans do 

- The golden ratio (1.618:1) -> ratio of spirals in seashells,pinecones and pineapples is exactly the same, human body, architecture 

- Most maths students in secondary schools about these relationships and they will not even know they exist.

  - personâ€™s height divided by the distance from tummy button to the floor; or the distance from shoulders to finger-tips, divided by the distance from elbows to finger-tips
  - United Nations Building, the Greek Parthenon, and the pyramids of Egypt

- Illuminating relationships such as thouse found in shapes and in nature 

- Express relations and ideas in numerical, graphical, symbolic, verbal and pictorial forms

- Misled by the image of maths presented in school maths classrooms as not given opportunity to experience real maths 

- School students says maths is 'a list of rules and procdures that need to be remembered'

- Mathematicans often not very good at calculations as they do not feature centrally in their work. Will say 'study of patterns'

- Classrooms should give children a sense of the nature of mathematics 

  ##### Fermat's Last Theorem

  > Theory becam the challenge of centuries. World's greatest Mathematical Problem

  - Got his theory from considering Pythagoras theorem -> school children learn from triangles 
  - Andrew Wiles was the man who solved this 
  - He constructued beautiful new mathmatical methods and relationships
  - Long and complicated problems are important 
    - enocurage persistence,value that is critical for young people to develop and that will stand them in good stead in life and work

- Mathematicans are interviewed often talk about enjoyment in solving difficult problems

- Hard for a school child to enjoy a subject if they experience repeated failure.

- Mathematicans are successful is because they can problem solve 

- Kind of about guessing. Kids at school are surprised as they have learnt to be precise -> don't have a good feel for numbers 

- At school kids learn the methods and how to use them in problems

- Work in collabration not isolation

- maths is all about going from an answer to a question -> requires ingenuity, thinking and creativity

- mathematical methods and relationships known and taught to school children started as questions,  students do not see the questions.  taught content that often appears as a long list of answers to questions that nobody has ever asked

- students need to be given opportunites to ask their own questions and to extend problems in new direction

- Posing and extending problems of interest to students mean they enjoy mathematics more, they feel more ownership of their work and they ultimately learn more.

- Mathematical coursework no longer exists in England as it was decided that it too often led to cheating

  - to use maths in the solving of real and interesting problems

- use of a range of representations such as symbols, words, pictures, tables and diagrams, all used with extreme precision

- For some it is good where there are rules for writing and communicating but for others it is too hard 

- many school approaches is that students should spend years being drilled in a set of methods that they can use later

- mathematicians are most concerned about the students who will enter post-graduate programs in mathematics

- students will encounter real mathematics and use the tools they have learned in school to work in new, interesting and authentic way

- Most will have given up on the subject 

- If they could work like mathematicans, they would see what maths is like, and be given opportunties to enjoy maths and learn it in the most productive way 

  ### Mathematics Teaching 1994 Conference Report

  #### Why do we Teach Mathematics in School?

  ##### Why should this question bother us?

  > Reasons why maths is in the curriculum is different to why it should actually be in the curriculum

  - Seems intellectually unacceptable not to know why we exercise our various professions in mathematics education
  - Need to present agruements to justify mathematics : in front of students, community and society at large
  - Need to think about the purpose, goal and aim of mathematics education we are offering to pupils 

  ##### Types of answers traditionally encountered

  - produce higher emotions & giving mental pleasure 
  - brain development 
  - producing logical ways of thinking 
  - aid given by mathematical weapons on the study of physical sciences 
  - in passing examinations 
  - give men mental tools to use 
  - teaching a man importance of thinking things out for himself
  - making men feel that they know the principles on which it is founded 
  - giving acute philosophical minds a logical counsel of perfection altogether charming and satisfying

  - appreciate greater problems of the worls, the solution of which depends on maths and science 
  - enable each pupil to develop mathematical skill and understanding required for adult life, for employment, for study and training
  - learn a powerful means of communication
  - need to stop teaching maths just because we should 
  - *Utilitarian Arguments*
    - occupational needs
    - coping with everyday private life 
    - prequisties for the study of other subjects
  - *General education Arguments*
    - developing formative capactities eg: logical thinking , analytic, systematic, memory, imagination, clarity and precision of expression, 
    - developing personality and attitudes eg: independent & autonomous thinking and behaviour, problem solving, precision and accuracy, discipline, perservance, confidences 
    - Aesthetic and recreational pleasure 
    - insight into human culture and achievement 
  - Serve society as :
    - demands for labour force in order to further economic/technological development
    - ideology and politics 
    - culture
  - serve individual needs concering 
  -  Socio-economic and occupational welfare 
  - Citizenship & social life 
  - everyday private life 

  - Can create an argument-purpose-matrix (draw please)

    - cells are non-void from both as you can find represented in docs and lit on maths

  - Times and socieities give different weight to cells 

    ##### Attempts to reconstruct society's real reasons for providing maths education to population

    Maths is :

    - a pure science 
    - an applied science which helps understand and develop extra-mathematical matters
    - a system of instruments for practice i.e products and processes that can assist extra- mathematical decisions and actions 
    - a field of aesthetics (beauty,pleasure and excitment)
    -  a teaching subject

  - Maths is unique:

    - has 5 properties at same time 
    - can be used in mutliple areas 
    -  2 maths linked to functioning and development of society at large :
      - other science subjects 
      - speicalised practise areas 
      - general practise areas 

  - Contributes to the shaping of society

  ##### Mathematics education for democracy

  > should provide post-elementary maths ed to all pupils

  - shapes society, mathematical competence tends to be a scarce resource 

  - provide insight into the 'general'

  - Enable, understand and relate to, act on the role of maths 

  - Students should :

    - be able to independently activate & apply maths problems in the real world 
    - Enable to discover, understand and assess others' implicity or explict use of maths in situations 
    - Experience & acquire a feel for range and limitations of application of maths to extra mathematical situations 
    - enable to act with confidence, competence and creativity within universe
    - Communicate with others about mayyers with a mathematical content 
    - acquire understanding of special nature of maths 
    - should acquire some insight in history and development of maths 
    - relations between maths and society 

    

  ## Week 2 Core Reading 

  ### How children learn mathematics: a guide for parents and teachers

  #### Piaget's Interviews with Children 

  > Tests took the form of an interview conducted with indvidual children. designed tests for conservation of number, length, capacity and weight 

  Testing the ability to link pairing and cardinal number. Testing length conservation by moving two sticks to see if they think it has changed 

  #### Piaget's Immutable Sequence of Development

  > bulit a theory of cognitive development, development of knowledge by children, passed through a sequence of stage

  - Grouped stages into four periods of development with a child's congnitive growth

  - *Period 1* (birth to 18 months) - sensori motor

    - Learns to associate sensation with action
    - Learns the concept of permanence of objects 
    - Maturer baby learns things exist when you can't see it, also learns the concept of reversibility

  - *Period 2* (18 months - 7 yrs) intuitive

    - (18 months - 4 yrs): 
      - Representation: using words to represent objects, relations between objects
      - Perception develops 
    - (4 - 7 yrs):
      - Confident that the world is as he perceives it 
      - More numerous, doesn't have the concept of horizontal yet
      - Percepetion is egocentric (cannot see anything from another viewpoint)
      - Solve problems by empirical tests instead of logical relations
      - Conflicts between perception and reasoning, understood number conservation
      - able to think two criteria simultaneously 

  - *Period 3* (7 - 12 yrs) concrete operational

    - improves logic to physical situations 
    - builds mental structures to generalize physical situations 
    - Concept of reversilibity deepens 
    - can make transitive inferences 

  - *Period 4* (12 yrs+) formal operational

    - ability to agrue from abstract hypothesis and to make deductions on basis of logic 

    #### Immutable Chain of Development 

    > Periods of cognitive growth include many stages which kids pass through in precisely the same order

    - attain conservation of number, length, capactiy and weight in that order 
    - won't attain 'horizontal' before 'parallel'
    - no amount of teaching can accelerate this 

    #### Challenges of Piaget's Theory 

    1. order of development is not invariant for every child 
       -  Studies show some African children develop number concepts at a later stage than European but develop concept of horizontal much earlier 
    2. development can be acclerated by teaching 
       - Conservation of liquid 
         - child who recognized reversibility of pouring will say yes 
         - Bruner said not only principle involved as y contained same amount as x, z must contain same amount as x 
         - Non conservers would agree with first part of agrument
    3. severely underrates the powers of inference of young children 
       - Piaget said children unable to do this until concerte operational period 
       - Bryant and Trabasso performed an experiment to show 4 year old can do this 
       - Inference than egocentric perception that causes children to draw water parallel to base of jar
    4. pays insufficient attention to the way in which young children interpret language
       - Maraget Donaldson, tester rather than child who exhibits egocentricity
       - shouldn't assume child uses certain words, they understand it in same sense that adults do , comprehension comes after use
       - Childen intrepret what is said by gestures and facial expressions. Failure occures more likely to be because of interpretaion than of reasoning 
       - Failure is an inability to abstract language from its context

    - Ability of abstract language from context is what is required maths 

    ##### Conclusions 

    > Drawn our attention to behaviour that is characteristic of child after children

    ### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp) 

    #### Chapter 7 : Formation of Mathematical Concepts 

    #### Abstracting and Classifying 

    > Children have classification of their previous experience, fitting of their present experience into one of these classes. Everyone does this 

    - Classify every time we recognise an object as one which we have seen before 
    - Varying inputs -> invariant properties - can tell the similarties a lot easier than differences 
    - Concepts require a number of experiences which have something in common, once formed we talk about examples of the concept
    - objects that stand out from surroundings are more liekly to be remembered 

    ##### Communication of concepts 

    > language used to speed up making a concept by helping to collect and separate examples and non-examples 

    - usually in maths this is what is done 
    - Trying to describe red 
      - wavelength - doesn't actually mean anything 
      - showing what is red is more understandable (auxiliary)

    - Sensory and motor experience of the outside world **(primary concepts)** . Ones that are abstracted are **(secondary concepts)**
    - Order between concepts and a conceptual hierachy makes us understand more why some concepts can only be formed once others have formed
    - Definitions can be seen as a way of adding precison to the boundaries of a concept
    - Commuication of maths is more difficult on paert of communicator and receiver. 
      - concepts of a higher order in a hierachy than those which a person already has cannot be communicated by definition can now be deduced 

  ##### The learning of Mathematical Concepts

  > everyday knowledge is learnt directly from our enivronment and concepts involved are not very abstract

  - Maths cannot be learnt directly from the everyday environment but indirectly from other mathematicans. Dependence of teachers and can cause fear and dislike of maths
  - The communicator of ideas is who needs to know them
  - Concepts of a higher order than those which a person already has cannot be communicated to him by definition, but only arranging for him to encounter a suitable collection of examples
  - Maths, examples are almost invariably other concepts, must ensure these are formed in mind of learner 
  - first is broken is majority of textbooks. New topics are introduced by definitions not examples 
    - examples must have common properties to form the concept, must be alike so can be abstracted.
  - Before we try to introduce a concept, we need to find out what its contributory concept are until we reach primary concepts. then a suitable plan can be made
  - problem with this is if you don't fully understand something you won't get the higher concepts (important in maths)
  - in physics you can understand heat and light without knowing about sound, maths you can't understand algebra without arithmetic.
  - Students learn manipulations with a imperfect understanding of underlying principles. 
  - all subsequent concepts may not be understood. Depends on the learner and level of comprehension
  - contributory concepts needed for each new stage of abstraction must be available. 

  ##### Learning and Teaching

  > create concepets in our mind, only able to do this by using concepts arrived at by past mathematicans

  - dependent on good teaching in early stages 
  - to know maths is different to teaching it (communicating at a lower conceptual level)

  ### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp) 

  #### Chapter 2 : The Idea of a Schema 

  - Given a collection not of a single object but *pairs* of objects, we can become aware of something in common between the pairs 
  - Order & equivalence relations have important properties
  - Study of structures is important in maths & study of ways in which they are bulit and function is core of psychology of learning maths 

##### The Integrative function of a schema 

> recognize something as an example of a concept we become aware of it in two levels : itself and as a member of this class 

- class concept is linked by our mental schema with lots of other concepts, avaliable to help us behave adaptively to the situation of that object
- *More schemas we have available, better chance of coping with unexpected*

##### The Schema as a tool for further learning 

> almost every we learn depends on knowing something else

- schematically learnt material was not only better, also better retained 
- learning schematically, learning in a efficient way, preparing a mental tool for applying the same thing to future tasks in that field 
- if task in isolation, schematic learning can take longer (solving equations - remebering rules a lot easier to do it than understanding the rules for the future)
- New experience which fits into exisiting schema is a lot better remembered, what doesn't fit into it a lot isn't really learn and what is learnt temporarily is soon forgotten
- Schema seems very adaptable but may not be depending on the situation. Schemas need to be able to change their structure, reconstruction is sometimes require before new situation is understood. if it fails, new expereince cannot be interpreted and individual cannot cope
- Basic mathematical schema is natural number system (with + and  $\times$)  bring in fractions and that's another one as multiplication cannot be considered as repeated addition , number schema needs to go under reconsturction 
- some people go through without understanding fractions
- diffciulty of reconstructing a schema:
  - Hindu-arabic system of numerals for natural numbers met with great resistance when introduced into Europe, some made it illegal

##### Understanding 

> To understand something means to assimilate it into an appropriate schema 

- Better internal organization of a schema can help improve understanding 

- rule with explanation is always better than just giving the rule.

##### Implications for the learning of mathematics 

> central importance of the schema as aa tool of learning means that inappropriate early schemas will make the assimilation of later ideas much more difficult, perhaps impossible 

- test adaptability of learner is to give them new mathematically related situations 
- Bright children can memorize a lot, apperance of learning maths can be matained until a level is reached at which true conceptual learning is adequate to the situation 
- an apporiate schema is one which takes into account the long term learning task and not immediate one 
- equations : based on the idea of a pair of scales . but cannot do it for quadractics etc 
- sometimes hard to choose between short-term inital schema and harder long-term one 
- responsibility of teachers in early stages of learning is high; make sure that schematic learning, not memorizing manipluation of symbols is taking places
  - need to think about what stages require straightforward assimilation and when reconstruction is needed 
  - help pupils find patterns, teach them to look and teach them to be able to reconstruct 

### The Psychogoly of Learning Maths (Richard Skemp)

#### Chapter 12 Relational Understanding and Instrumental Understanding

Haven't been able to read this, can't get it online 

## Week 3 Core Reading 

### Learning to teach in the primary school

#### Chapter 2.2 Looking at Learning

##### Introduction

> natrual process that we do everyday, understanding how we learn is not as straightforward

> learning is a relatively persistent change in an individual's possible behaviour due to experience 

##### Behaviourism 

> reaction against the introspective psychology.

- **Knowledge**:
  - repertoire of behaviours, knowledge is action
  - set of passive, mechanical responses to environmental stimuli 
- **Learning**:
  - Info from teacher -> learner : trasmission of response appopriate to certain stimulus 
  - point of education is to present the learner with appropriate repertoire of behavioural responses to specific stimuli & reinforce responses through an effective reinforcement schedule
  - -> requires consistent repetition of materal , should be small progressive tasks & continious positive reinforcement should be given, without this, learned responses will quickly become extinct, learner continue to modify behaviour until they receive positive reinforcement 
- **Motivation**:
  - pleaseant experiences cause human learners to make desired connections between specific stimuli & appropriate responses
- **Teaching**:
  - `skill` or `drill` exercises to provided the consistent repetition for effective reinforcement of response patterns
  - postitive reinforcement 
  - questions (stimulus) & answer (response) sequences, in which questions are of gradually increasing difficulty, guided practice and regular reviews of material . 
  - Use tests and examinations to measure degree of learning 
  - Proved most succesful where there is a correct response or easily memorised material. Usefulness in teaching comprehension and composition is questionable 

##### Constructivism

> knowledge comprises symbolic mental representations such as propositions and images, together with mechanism. Actively constructed by learners, based on their existing cognitive structures 

- Jean Piaget said learning is a dynamic process comprising successive stages of adaptation to reality, learners construct knowledge by creating & testing own theories of world
  - basic principle -> principle of equilibration (balancing) : cognitive development progress towards complex, but stable mental representations of the world
  - humans have been resistant to new ideas as they have inbulity need for stability 
- learners adapt and develop by assimilating and accommodating new information into existing cognitive structures 
- **Knowledge**:
  - Actively constructed by learners, any account of knowledge makes essential references to cognitive structures within learner's mind
  - complex set of mental representaions derived from past learning experiences,interprets experiences and info in light of existing knowledge, stage of cognitive development, cultural background, personal history and so on
- **Learning**:
  - learning is a process of active discovery
  - role of teacher is to faciliate discovery, by providing resources & guiding learners attempt to assimilate new knowledge
- **Motivation**:
  - Learners must face up to limitations of their own knowledge and accept need to modify or abandon existing beliefs
- **Teaching**:
  - Importance of strategies to help learns assimilate and accomadate new material
  - practical acitivity, physical manipulation of objects 

##### Social Constructivism

> Emphasis that collabroative nature of learning, process by which learners were integrated into a knowledge community 

- **Knowledge**:
  - language & culture in cognitive development important to how humans perceive the world 
  - Framework of how humans experience, communicate and understand reality
- **Learning**:
  - Actual development : learner capable of solving problems independly 
  - Potential development: learner capable under guidance of teachers or in collaboration with peers
- **Motivation:**
  - Both extrinsic and intrinsic, partially motivated by rewards provided by the knowledge community
- **Teaching**:
  - Develop team work skills, all about team work

### Teaching Mathematics

#### Being Mathematical within a mathematical community

##### Constructivism

> perspective on knowledge and learning which suggests that any person's knowledge is not acquired from outside but constructed by that individual 

- learn by adapting what they know to fit with what they experience in the world around them 
- implication of this belief is that not possible to say something to someone else and expect them to understand exactly the meaning that was intended to be conveyed 

##### Making models 

- different images can contribute to similar models , people's perception of others can be so different to my own
- models can be adapted from interaction and discussion with others in the group

##### Being Mathematical

- idea was to see how people think and they decided to bring in mathematics 
- spotted patterns and tried to express the generalities which they could see

##### A Mathematical Community 

> need to communicate mathematical ideas and contrast ways of seeing mathematics in different communities to reach common ground 

- encourages individual constructing of mathematical ideas and fosters negotiation & social mediation which leads to shared meanings being developed 

##### In the Classroom

- **Pythagoras Theorem:**
  - With disucssions able to think about using fractional numbers not just whole numbers
- **Area or Perimeter:**
  - desicribe what they saw 
  - respect ideas 
- **Differentiation:**
  - learn the value of articulating what they think they know 

##### Being a mathematican

- Individual construction of mathematical knowledge 
- to be a mathematican is to mathematisie a situation created 
- dicussing ideas like this reinforces this as concepts are developed
