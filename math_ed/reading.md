### Teaching mathematics in secondary schools : a reader

#### Being mathematically educated in the twenty-first century: what should it mean?

##### Introduction

- Mathematics was a subject studied by the elite few
- Nineteenth century (grammar and public schools) only had a small number of children 
  - Maths taught in the class was pure (geometry) | topics that would be useful to a nation of inventors
  - anything above basic education was a waste of resources
- ***Education Act 1870*** - introduced compulsory education until 1988 where a **National Curriculum** was introduced
- 1960s & 1970s -> UK economic interests to have an educated, skilled workforce. Too many people were leaving school both earlier and less well-qualified that contential counterparts. Emerging economies started booming

##### Mathematics in the twentieth century 

- 1900 David Hilbert gave a talk to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris 
  - He discussed 23 unsolved problems he forecast would take attention of mathematicans.
- New topics sprung up in the last century; mathematical statistics, discrete maths and applications, quantum mechanics, chaos and game theory
  - Geometry & analysis have advanced 

##### Some aspects of Mathematics in schools 

Standards of instruction to allow a school to be certified as efficient (1876):

- 50% of people above 7 years old will be tested(in reading, writing & arthmetic)
  - 50% should pass in 2 subjects. 50% should pass in arthemtic 
- 7 - 8 years: form figures up to 20, name at sight figures up to 20, add& subtract figures up to 10, orally and from board
- 8 - 10 years: Simple addition & subtraction of numbers <= figures. Mutliplications tables to 6 
- 10 years +: Short division 
- Looking at how maths was tested at schools from 1933 contained 10 questions. 
  - 3 questions on 'pure' geometry 
  - 2 on pratical arthmetic
  - 1 on scale drawing. graphs, trigonometry, algebraic manipulation, number and proof
- With algbraic manipulation trick is to get to the expression
- 16 years later :
  - 3 on pure geometry 
  - 2 on arthmetic 
  - 3 accurate drawing 
  - 3 algebra 
  - 1 on graph drawing 
- Maths being taught to pupils could be regarded as an outcome of an unwritten conspiracy between grammar schools and unis to preserve supply of professional mathematicians and not to worry about any other national needs 
- School Mathematics Project for kids who would not do maths beyong o level but suitable to who takes it further 
- Goal was 
  - school maths more exciting and enjoyable 
  - Impart a knowledge of nature of mathematics and uses to modern world 
  - encourage pupils to pursue further the study of mathematics 
  - bridge gulf between uni and school maths 
  - Reflect changes brought about by increased automation and introduction of computers 
- London Mathematical Society(1995) on the lack of algebraic and manipulative facility among incoming undergraduates 
- Increased emphasis on algbraic structure, definitions and axioms 
- Shift towards Pure Maths with Stats and away from Pure Maths with Mechanics notably among females
- Core maths is half the syllabus-> then can pick whatever they want afterwards
- Restructing of maths in England have had side affects:
  - England and Scotland appear badly but these exclude topic such as statistics and data handling 
  - In Far East good technical competence, high motivation to absorb and regurgitate but poor ability to adapt to situations 
-  Japan : called an increase in time allocated to maths at high school 

##### Technology

- The UK embraced calculators.
- A Level examining boards in maths recommend students have access to scienctific/graphical calculators 
- Algebra packages such as maple, mathematica and derive are common 
- Develop maths as a experimental subjects 
- Techonolgy based developments which include both computer aided learning packages as well as interactive and dynamic teaching materials, have the capability to transform the way pupils understand and learn mathematics.
- The variety of the visual presentation of mathematical knowledge through media instead of one-dimensional world of the textbook will open new horizons for pupils  for all abilities but particully for thouse who find vebally presented data more difficult to comprehend 

##### Mathematical education in the twenty-first century 

> Majority of people unaware of impact of mathematics through interaction with developing technology

- Lack of sense of what maths can and cannot do means politcal policy makers who take advice on all manner of issues from civil servants using maths models often lack any means of juding whether those models are appropriate or indeed of what questions they should be asking 
- Maths perceived as difficult but as remote in its own language 
- Need it to relate to real people 
- Acquire :
  - basic skills & knowledge for everyday life 
  - development of the ability to think and reason logically 
  - maths models / maths as an language / problem solving 
- Poltical issue with this :
  - deciding what content of apporiate mathematical syllabuses should consist of
  - supply of teachers capable of delivering this mathematics 
  - amount of time devoted to maths within curriculum at different stages
- Less maths teachers 
- Compulsory for everyone till 16
- serious about providing basic skills as well as building the platform that encourages kids to study further -> maths needs to be assigned more time 
- Taiwan schools teach 222 days per year, UK only 190 days 15 hours a week on maths three times as much as UK
- an increase in maths will not happen unless the maths communtiy make a case for learning and appreciating maths that will decrease time spent on other subjects or school day or year needs to be extended 
- Post 16 situation more complex 
  - Maths compulsory part of baccalaureate (hard decding what maths to include)
- Define what mathematically educated means distinguish make math its own disciple part of tradition and maths as a tool of understanding the complex world 

##### Conclusion

- need basic maths as "life skills"
- employers who require technique, knowledge, think logically and to be organised and systematic, policy makers and decsion makers
- Innovation industries driving maths like tech 
- Subject expanding beyond capability of an ordinary person to understand 
- remotness is an obstacle to make person more enganged with maths 
- Maths depends on recuriting students, create a wider understanding on why it should be supported 
- Reliance on computers to give answers without understanding 

### The Elephant in the Classroom

#### What is Maths ?

- ***Reuben Hersh (What is Mathematics Really) *** - People don't like maths because of the way it is mis-represented in school

  - bears little to maths of life & work or even maths with mathematicans do 

- The golden ratio (1.618:1) -> ratio of spirals in seashells,pinecones and pineapples is exactly the same, human body, architecture 

- Most maths students in secondary schools about these relationships and they will not even know they exist.

  - personâ€™s height divided by the distance from tummy button to the floor; or the distance from shoulders to finger-tips, divided by the distance from elbows to finger-tips
  - United Nations Building, the Greek Parthenon, and the pyramids of Egypt

- Illuminating relationships such as thouse found in shapes and in nature 

- Express relations and ideas in numerical, graphical, symbolic, verbal and pictorial forms

- Misled by the image of maths presented in school maths classrooms as not given opportunity to experience real maths 

- School students says maths is 'a list of rules and procdures that need to be remembered'

- Mathematicans often not very good at calculations as they do not feature centrally in their work. Will say 'study of patterns'

- Classrooms should give children a sense of the nature of mathematics 

  ##### Fermat's Last Theorem

  > Theory becam the challenge of centuries. World's greatest Mathematical Problem

  - Got his theory from considering Pythagoras theorem -> school children learn from triangles 
  - Andrew Wiles was the man who solved this 
  - He constructued beautiful new mathmatical methods and relationships
  - Long and complicated problems are important 
    - enocurage persistence,value that is critical for young people to develop and that will stand them in good stead in life and work

- Mathematicans are interviewed often talk about enjoyment in solving difficult problems

- Hard for a school child to enjoy a subject if they experience repeated failure.

- Mathematicans are successful is because they can problem solve 

- Kind of about guessing. Kids at school are surprised as they have learnt to be precise -> don't have a good feel for numbers 

- At school kids learn the methods and how to use them in problems

- Work in collabration not isolation

- maths is all about going from an answer to a question -> requires ingenuity, thinking and creativity

- mathematical methods and relationships known and taught to school children started as questions,  students do not see the questions.  taught content that often appears as a long list of answers to questions that nobody has ever asked

- students need to be given opportunites to ask their own questions and to extend problems in new direction

- Posing and extending problems of interest to students mean they enjoy mathematics more, they feel more ownership of their work and they ultimately learn more.

- Mathematical coursework no longer exists in England as it was decided that it too often led to cheating

  - to use maths in the solving of real and interesting problems

- use of a range of representations such as symbols, words, pictures, tables and diagrams, all used with extreme precision
- For some it is good where there are rules for writing and communicating but for others it is too hard 
- many school approaches is that students should spend years being drilled in a set of methods that they can use later
- mathematicians are most concerned about the students who will enter post-graduate programs in mathematics
- students will encounter real mathematics and use the tools they have learned in school to work in new, interesting and authentic way
- Most will have given up on the subject 
- If they could work like mathematicans, they would see what maths is like, and be given opportunties to enjoy maths and learn it in the most productive way
